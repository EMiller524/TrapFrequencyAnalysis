Gradient Debugging:

    Current known problems:
    - Not fully repeatable, within 5 runs may alternate between 2-3 soulutions
    - One of these soulutions is usualy the initial guess (no matter)
    - Some will get fully stuck on the inital guess (ie never returning something but the intial guess)
    - 

    Possible fixes:
    - Bassinhopoing <-- Takes a long time
    - Run 5 times over... and take Umin
    - Dig into why getting stuck on intial pos... sometimes not even close to known...








the classic 3n X 3n matrix diagnolization assumes harmonic…
I think the higher order tensors should hold information as to how these modes interact
Maybe the 3rd and 4th (3n x 3n x 3n x 3n) forms will have a reasonable extraction process?
Like maybe you assume harmonicity, then you change the basis of 3rd and 4th tensors with the R^3n eigenvectors found, and then a diagnolization process can give some insight…
For example, the pairwise output would represent the “cross talk” between those 2 modes (or 3 or 4)... 













Equations/constants to confirm:

trap_freq_k = sqrt(
                    ion_charge * 2nd_deriv_in_k_direction
                    / 
                    ion_mass
                )


trap_freq_radial = (((trap_freq_y**2) * (trap_freq_z**2)) ** (1 / 2))/2


ion_mass = 2.885 * (10 **(-25)) #kg
ion_charge = 1.60217662  * (10 **(-19)) #C


28 Mhz for RF usually?
What voltage?
Whats the normal range for:
    axial freq:
    radial freq:


    - Not going to be in this week (midtermmmmms), and problem sets got moved around so thursday and fridays are gonna work better now
    
    - Got to the point where from the COMSOL generated potential I can:
        * get the total potential at any point --> Hessian --> principal frequencys
    
    - To do on code side:
        * check with actual experimental data -- Where can I get that?
        * functionality:
            - check for desired symetrys in a simualtion
            - search for electrode configs for inputed frequencys
            - basic UI to change variables to change freqencys
    
    - To do else:
        * get the COMSOL data for a non simplified trap:
            - take into account the grounded surfaces, and full electrodes
            - define poitential at the source not nessecarly of the surfaces
            - will most likely need a cluster for this --> killian group?? Should I contact someone??
