Equations/constants to confirm:

trap_freq_k = sqrt(
                    ion_charge * 2nd_deriv_in_k_direction
                    / 
                    ion_mass
                )


trap_freq_radial = (((trap_freq_y**2) * (trap_freq_z**2)) ** (1 / 2))/2


ion_mass = 2.885 * (10 **(-25)) #kg
ion_charge = 1.60217662  * (10 **(-19)) #C


28 Mhz for RF usually?
What voltage?
Whats the normal range for:
    axial freq:
    radial freq:


    - Not going to be in this week (midtermmmmms), and problem sets got moved around so thursday and fridays are gonna work better now
    
    - Got to the point where from the COMSOL generated potential I can:
        * get the total potential at any point --> Hessian --> principal frequencys
    
    - To do on code side:
        * check with actual experimental data -- Where can I get that?
        * functionality:
            - check for desired symetrys in a simualtion
            - search for electrode configs for inputed frequencys
            - basic UI to change variables to change freqencys
    
    - To do else:
        * get the COMSOL data for a non simplified trap:
            - take into account the grounded surfaces, and full electrodes
            - define poitential at the source not nessecarly of the surfaces
            - will most likely need a cluster for this --> killian group?? Should I contact someone??
